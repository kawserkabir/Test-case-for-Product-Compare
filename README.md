#This is a testing checklist for web and desktop applications.

Make testing checklist as an integral part of test cases writing process. Using this checklist you can easily create hundreds of test cases for testing web or desktop applications. These are all general test cases and should be applicable for almost all kind of applications. Refer these tests while writing test cases for your project and Iâ€™m sure you will cover most testing types except the application specific business rules provided in your SRS documents.

Though this is a common checklist, I recommend preparing a standard testing checklist tailored to your specific needs using below test cases in addition with application specific tests.
